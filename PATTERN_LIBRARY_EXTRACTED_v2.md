**Extracted:** 2025-10-21, Instance 37
**Source:** Gemini 2.5 Pro analysis of 2 titan videos
**Purpose:** Concrete, replicable editing patterns for production

## CORE TEMPLATE (Sustainable for 50+ Videos)

### **Visual Transitions**

**Primary Method: Hard Cuts (95%+)**
- No dissolves, fades, or complex wipes
- Prioritizes speed and clarity
- Cuts synchronized to narration phrases

**Secondary: Horizontal Wipes**
- New panels slide in from right
- Creates split-screen effect (2-panel default)
- Full-screen wipes for scene changes

**Frequency:**
- Fast sections: 1-2 seconds per panel
- Standard: 3-6 seconds per panel
- Dictated by narration rhythm

---

### **Panel Animation (Creating Motion from Statics)**

**1. Ken Burns Effect (Primary)**
- Applied to almost EVERY panel
- Slow, subtle pan + zoom
- Guides viewer's eye
- Creates sense of life

**2. Impact Zooms**
- Very fast zoom-in
- Used for punchlines/dramatic emphasis
- Timed with narration beats

**3. Positional Panning**
- Vertical/horizontal movement across single panel
- Reveals information sequentially
- Mimics natural reading flow
- Example: Pan from face ‚Üí body

**4. Specialty Effects (Rare)**
- Fast rotation for disorientation
- Screen shake for impact
- Scan-line filters for flashbacks
- Particle effects for power-ups

---

### **Text Overlays (Minimal Use)**

**Character Names:**
- Fast pop-in + scale-up animation
- Heavy, jagged outline (colored)
- Texture overlay
- Slight shake on arrival
- Example timestamp: 0:02, 0:45

**Action/Sound Text:**
- Onomatopoeia with motion blur
- Timed perfectly with action
- Simple white font for subtitles
- Example: "SUCK" (5:39), "NOD" (0:51)

**System Text:**
- Digital/glitchy look for game elements
- Placed in notification boxes
- Example: "DING-" (5:51)

**Philosophy:** Let narration carry story, text is supplement only

---

### **Pacing & Rhythm**

**"Speak-Then-Show" Cadence:**
- Cuts synchronized to narrator's delivery
- Visual edit extends narration
- Cut happens at end of phrase/clause

**Fast Pacing (Action/Comedy):**
- 1-2 seconds per panel
- Rapid hard cuts
- Multiple angles of same action
- Example: 5:11-5:24 (zombie fight)

**Slow Pacing (Emotional/Setting):**
- 3-6 seconds per panel
- Slow pan to establish location
- Gives audience absorption time
- Example: 2:07-2:13 (apartment building)

**Rhythmic Beats:**
- Even timing for sequences
- 1-2 seconds per count
- Matches narration cadence
- Example: 3:43-3:57 (exercise count)

---

### **Hook/Opening Technique**

**Cold Open Method:**
- NO formal title card
- Immediate narration start
- Rapid-fire montage (0:00-0:15)
- Cherry-picked visually appealing panels

**Elements:**
1. **Establishes tone** (fast-paced, meme-style)
2. **Sets premise** (clear genre signals)
3. **Shows payoff** (visual gags as hook)
4. **Filters audience** (appeals to niche)

**Audio:**
- Fast, colloquial, slightly sarcastic narrator
- Upbeat, high-tempo background music
- Starts INSTANTLY (no buildup)

**Why It Works:**
- Within 30 seconds: tone + premise + hook + audience filter
- Information density demands attention
- Pop-culture references create instant context

---

### **Retention Techniques**

**Information Density:**
- Constant visual motion (pan/zoom)
- Rapid cuts paired with fast narration
- Demands full attention to follow plot
- No opportunities for mind to wander

**Audio-Visual Sync:**
- 100% synced to vocal track (not music)
- Cuts match narrator's delivery precisely
- Example: "blood gushes out" ‚Üí cut on "blood"

**Visual Variety:**
- Alternates between split-screen and full-screen
- Uses external pop-culture images for comparison
- Flashbacks use distinct filters (scan-lines, tilt)
- Power-up moments get vibrant color overlays

---

### **Color Grading/Filters**

**Overall Grade:**
- Slight cool, blue-green tint
- Consistent stylized aesthetic
- Applied to entire frame + background

**Specialty Filters:**
- **Flashbacks:** Horizontal scan-lines + desaturation
- **Dream sequences:** Darker, deep blues/purples, high contrast
- **Power auras:** Vibrant glow overlays (blue/yellow/red)
- **Unconsciousness:** Fade to B&W + heavy vignette

---

### **Production Quality Tier**

**Assessment: Medium-Simple**

**Complexity Level:**
- More advanced than slideshow (constant keyframing)
- Tight audio-visual synchronization
- But: No motion tracking, 3D moves, custom graphics

**Tools Required:**
- Adobe Premiere Pro OR DaVinci Resolve
- Standard timeline-based editing
- NO After Effects needed
- NO specialized VFX software

**Workflow:**
1. Lay down narration track
2. Match panels to audio beats
3. Apply Ken Burns to all clips
4. Add background music
5. Export

**Sustainability:** EXTREMELY HIGH
- Essentially a refined template
- Quick replication across different series
- Built for high-volume production
- Can sustain 50+ video output

---

## REPLICABILITY FACTORS

**What Stays Constant:**
- Hard cut style

- Speak-then-show cadence
- Cold open structure
- Minimal text overlay philosophy

**What Varies Per Story:**
- Panel selection
- Narration script content
- Background music genre
- Color grading intensity
- Specific panel arrangement

**Template Elements:**
- Horizontal wipe transition

- Narration-driven pacing
- Retention through density

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (What NOT to Do)

‚ùå Complex transitions (dissolves, fancy wipes)
‚ùå Text-heavy storytelling
‚ùå Music-driven editing (sync to voice, not beat)
‚ùå Long static holds (kills retention)
‚ùå Overcomplicated VFX (unsustainable)
‚ùå Formal intros/title cards (lose hook time)

‚úì Simple, fast, repeatable
‚úì Narration-synchronized
‚úì Template-based workflow
‚úì High information density
‚úì Sustainable for scale
