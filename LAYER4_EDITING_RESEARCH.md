# LAYER 4: VIDEO EDITING RESEARCH

**Status:** üîç RESEARCH PHASE - **MOST MURKY/UNCLEAR**  
**Tool:** Adobe Premiere Pro (programmatic approach)  
**Date:** 2025-10-21

---

## THE CORE CHALLENGE

**How do we automate video editing from structured data?**

**Input:**
- Panel images (Layer 0)
- Panel analysis manifest (Layer 1)
- Narration audio (Layer 3)

**Output:**
- Final edited video matching titan-tier quality

**The Gap:** This is not a solved problem in our pipeline.

## KNOWN REQUIREMENTS (From Titan Video Analysis)

### Visual Patterns
- Hard cuts (95%+ transitions)
- Ken Burns effect on every panel (slow pan + zoom)
- Impact zooms for emphasis
- Minimal text overlays
- Background music layer

### Timing Patterns
- Speak-then-show rhythm (cuts synced to narration)
- Variable hold times (1-2s fast, 3-6s standard, 5-8s slow)
- Audio-visual sync is CRITICAL

### Quality Markers
- Smooth motion (60fps export)
- Consistent color grading
- Professional polish
- High retention through pacing

---

## POSSIBLE APPROACHES

### Approach A: Premiere Pro Scripting (ExtendScript)

**Concept:** Use Adobe's ExtendScript API to programmatically build timeline

**Pros:**
- Industry-standard tool
- Full feature access
- Professional quality output
- Template system available

**Cons:**
- Complex API (JavaScript-based)
- Limited documentation
- Steep learning curve
- May require manual polish

**Research Needed:**
1. ExtendScript documentation
2. Timeline manipulation capabilities
3. Effect automation (Ken Burns)
4. Audio sync mechanisms
5. Export automation

**Key Questions:**
- Can we programmatically place clips with precise timing?
- Can we apply effects (pan, zoom) via script?
- Can we sync cuts to audio waveform peaks?
- Can we automate export settings?

---

### Approach B: FFmpeg + Python

**Concept:** Pure command-line video processing

**Pros:**
- Complete control
- Fully automated
- Open-source
- No licensing costs

**Cons:**
- VERY complex for advanced effects
- Slower iteration
- Lower-level control required
- May not achieve professional polish easily

**Research Needed:**
1. FFmpeg image sequence processing
2. Pan/zoom effects in FFmpeg
3. Audio-video synchronization
4. Timeline construction logic
5. Effect stacking

**Key Questions:**
- Can FFmpeg achieve smooth Ken Burns effect?
- How to time cuts to audio markers?
- Performance at scale (50+ videos)?
- Quality vs Premiere Pro output?

---

### Approach C: Hybrid (Template + Automation)

**Concept:** Premiere Pro template + ExtendScript population

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds
- Faster iteration
- Professional quality
- Reusable templates

**Cons:**
- Still requires some manual work
- Template design complexity
- May not be fully automated

**Process:**
1. Design Premiere Pro template structure
2. Use ExtendScript to populate:
   - Panel images in correct order
   - Audio track alignment
   - Effect parameters (timing, intensity)
3. Manual polish pass (if needed)

**Research Needed:**
- Premiere Pro template creation
- Dynamic template population
- Parameterized effects
- Batch processing capabilities

---

### Approach D: Specialized Tool (DaVinci Resolve API)

**Concept:** Use DaVinci Resolve's Python API instead of Premiere

**Pros:**
- Native Python support
- Powerful automation
- Free version available
- Professional features

**Cons:**
- Different tool from initial plan
- API learning curve
- May have limitations vs Premiere

**Research Needed:**
- DaVinci Resolve Python API capabilities
- Timeline automation
- Effect scripting
- Batch processing

---

## CRITICAL TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

### Challenge 1: Audio-Visual Sync
**Problem:** Cuts must happen precisely when narrator finishes phrases

**Approaches:**
1. **Waveform Analysis:**
   - Detect pauses in audio
   - Cut on silence markers
   - Requires audio processing library

2. **Manual Timing from Manifest:**
   - Use Layer 1 hold_time specifications
   - Calculate cumulative timestamps
   - Place cuts at calculated times

3. **Hybrid:**
   - Start with manifest times
   - Adjust based on audio analysis
   - Validate sync quality

**Research Target:** Which approach is most reliable?

---

### Challenge 2: Ken Burns Effect
**Problem:** Every panel needs smooth pan + zoom

**Premiere Pro Approach:**
- Apply Motion effect
- Keyframe Position (X, Y)
- Keyframe Scale
- Set easing (Bezier curves)

**FFmpeg Approach:**
- Use zoompan filter
- Calculate start/end coordinates
- Apply over duration

**Questions:**
- Can we parameterize pan direction based on panel content?
- How to vary zoom intensity for variety?
- How to ensure smoothness at 60fps?

---

### Challenge 3: Timing Calculation
**Problem:** Convert hold times + transitions into precise timeline positions

**Algorithm Needed:**
```python
def calculate_timeline():
    cumulative_time = 0
    for panel in manifest:
        # Start time for this panel
        panel.start_time = cumulative_time
        
        # Duration based on hold_time
        panel.duration = parse_time(panel.hold_time)
        
        # End time
        panel.end_time = cumulative_time + panel.duration
        
        # Add transition overlap if needed
        if panel.transition == "horizontal_wipe":
            # Overlap next panel by 0.5s
            cumulative_time += (panel.duration - 0.5)
        else:
            cumulative_time += panel.duration
    
    return timeline
```

**Validation:** Must match narration audio length exactly

---

### Challenge 4: Effect Parameterization
**Problem:** Different panels need different camera moves

**From Manifest:**
- `camera_move`: "ken_burns", "zoom_in", "pan_right", etc.
- `emphasis`: Describes what to highlight

**Translation Required:**
- "zoom_in" ‚Üí Scale from 100% to 120%, center on emphasis area
- "pan_right" ‚Üí Position from left to right, subtle zoom
- "ken_burns" ‚Üí Slight pan + zoom, direction based on panel content

**Research Needed:**
- How to auto-detect optimal pan direction?
- How to identify emphasis regions in panel?
- How to vary effects to avoid monotony?

## CRITICAL INSIGHT

**Perfect is the enemy of good.**

The goal is NOT flawless full automation Day 1.

The goal is:
1. ‚úÖ Prove quality is achievable (POC 1)
2. ‚úÖ Automate the tedious parts (POC 2)
3. ‚úÖ Scale to reasonable throughput (POC 3)

Even "80% automated + 15 min polish" is a MASSIVE win.

It transforms:
- 1 video/day (fully manual) 
- ‚Üí 5-10 videos/day (semi-automated)

That's enough to prove the business model.

Full automation is optimization for Opus.
