# MANHWA RECAP PRODUCTION TEMPLATE (Complete)
**Synthesized:** Editing + Narrative patterns from 3 titan videos
**Purpose:** End-to-end replicable blueprint for sustainable production
**Updated:** 2025-10-21, Instance 37

---

## PRODUCTION PHILOSOPHY

**Core Principle:** Template-based workflow for high-volume, sustainable output

**What This Enables:**
- 50+ videos with consistent quality
- Efficient production (minimize decision fatigue)
- Repeatable patterns = faster iteration
- Focus creative energy on story selection, not reinventing process

---

## PART 1: SCRIPT TEMPLATE

### **Structure (5-8 minutes total)**

**ACT 1: Cold Open Hook (0:00-0:30)**
```
[VISUAL: Rapid montage of 5-7 key panels]
[NARRATION STYLE: Fast, sarcastic, high-energy]

- Open with pop-culture comparison
- State core premise in one sentence
- Show 2-3 visual gags/hooks
- Establish narrator personality
- NO formal introduction, dive straight in

Example opening:
"Yo, imagine [POP CULTURE REFERENCE] but with [UNIQUE TWIST]. 
Our boy [MC NAME] just got [INCITING INCIDENT] and now he's gotta [CORE CONFLICT] 
with a bunch of [CHARACTER TYPE]. 
Let's see how this trainwreck unfolds."
```

**ACT 2: Premise Establishment (0:30-2:00)**
```
[PACING: 30-60 second micro-arcs]
[NARRATION: Conversational, meme-literate]

Section 1: Who is MC?
- Current situation
- Core personality trait
- Why we should care

Section 2: What's the setup?
- World/context in ONE sentence
- Key relationship dynamics
- Inciting incident clearly explained

Section 3: First major hook
- Fan service OR plot twist OR action moment
- Establish stakes
- End with tension/question
```

**ACT 3: Story Development (2:00-5:00)**
```
[STRUCTURE: Series of 30-60s micro-events]
[COMPRESSION: Skip ALL fluff]

Micro-Arc Template (repeat 3-5 times):
1. Event happens (10-15s)
2. Narration interprets significance (10-15s)
3. Visual gag or character moment (10-15s)
4. Transition to next event (5s)

What to INCLUDE:
✓ Character dynamics and tropes
✓ Plot catalysts
✓ Comedic/dramatic beats
✓ Fan service moments (retention hooks)

What to SKIP:
❌ World-building exposition
❌ Travel/transition scenes
❌ Detailed backstory (unless it's the hook)
❌ Anything that slows momentum
```

**ACT 4: Cliffhanger/Conclusion (5:00-end)**
```
[PACING: Accelerate toward peak]
[FUNCTION: Hook for next video/chapter]

- Major revelation or plot development
- Foreshadow future events
- Call out next episode tease
- End on unresolved tension

Example close:
"And just when you think it can't get crazier, 
[NEXT BIG THING] shows up, and oh boy, 
you're NOT ready for what happens next. 
Part 2 dropping soon, don't miss it."
```

## PART 2: VOICE & STYLE GUIDE

### **Narrator Persona**
- **Identity:** Genre-savvy friend explaining a series
- **Tone:** Sarcastic, colloquial, slightly irreverent
- **Language:** Internet slang, meme references, casual profanity (if appropriate)
- **Stance:** Self-aware about tropes, breaks fourth wall

### **Script Language Rules**

**DO:**
✓ Use "our MC" or "my boy/girl" (creates intimacy)
✓ Call out tropes explicitly ("the classic isekai cheat")
✓ Make pop culture comparisons ("like Kirito but...")
✓ Rhetorical questions ("Can he survive? Spoiler: no")
✓ Self-aware humor ("Better stop here before demonetization")
✓ Sentence fragments and run-ons (natural speech)

**DON'T:**
❌ Formal academic language
❌ Over-explain obvious visuals
❌ Neutral observer tone
❌ Complex sentence structure
❌ Describe without interpreting

### **Slang Vocabulary Bank**
```
Character types:
- Chad, trash loser, OP, thick babes, waifu, husbando
- Kirito wannabe, edge lord, cinnamon roll

Actions/Events:
- Gets bodied, takes an L, catches these hands
- Plot armor kicks in, speedrunning, grinding

Reactions:
- Ayy yo, hold up, down bad, based, cringe
- Not gonna lie, real talk, no cap

Meta:
- This man's built different
- The author said "bet"
- Fan service go brrr
```

## PART 3: VISUAL PRODUCTION

### **Panel Selection Strategy**

**Per Minute of Video:**
- 20-30 panels (1-3 seconds per panel typically)
- 60% story panels, 40% character/reaction shots

**Panel Priorities:**
1. Emotionally charged faces (reactions, expressions)
2. Action moments (fights, dramatic reveals)
3. Fan service (when present and appropriate)
4. Establishing shots (brief, only when necessary)

**Panel Quality Requirements:**
- High resolution (avoid pixelation when zoomed)
- Clear composition (main subject obvious)
- Good cropping potential (for Ken Burns effect)

### **Editing Workflow**

**Step 1: Lay Narration Track**
- Record full voiceover first
- Use audacity or similar (free tools)
- Fast, energetic delivery
- Match script's conversational tone

**Step 2: Sync Panels to Audio**
- Import panels into timeline
- Match each visual to narrator's words
- Follow "speak-then-show" rhythm
- Cut on phrase endings

**Step 3: Apply Animation**
- Ken Burns effect on EVERY panel
  - Slow pan and/or zoom (2-4 seconds)
  - Direction: toward subject's face/action
  - Subtle, not jarring
- Impact zooms for punchlines
  - Fast zoom (0.2-0.5 seconds)
  - Timed to comedic beats

**Step 4: Add Music**
- Upbeat, royalty-free electronic/hip-hop
- Background only (don't overpower narration)
- Consistent throughout video

**Step 5: Text Overlays (Minimal)**
- Character names: Pop-in animation, bold font, jagged outline
- Action text: Onomatopoeia with motion blur (rare)
- Watermark: Simple, corner placement
- NO excessive text - narration tells story

---

## PART 4: TECHNICAL SPECS

### **Software Stack**
**Required:**
- **Video Editor:** Premiere Pro OR DaVinci Resolve (free version works)
- **Audio:** Audacity (free) for voice recording
- **Panels:** Source from manhwa chapters (legal concerns: note in description)

**Optional:**
- ElevenLabs for AI voiceover (if not using own voice)
- Canva for thumbnails
- Bulk image downloaders for panel sourcing

### **Export Settings**
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 (1080p minimum)
- **Framerate:** 30fps
- **Format:** MP4 (H.264 codec)
- **Audio:** AAC, 192kbps, stereo
- **Length Target:** 5-8 minutes (sweet spot for retention)

### **Production Time Estimate**
**Per Video (once template mastered):**
- Script writing: 30-60 minutes
- Panel sourcing: 30-45 minutes
- Voice recording: 15-30 minutes
- Editing/animation: 60-90 minutes
- **Total: 2.5-4 hours per video**

**With automation/efficiency:**
- Target: 3 hours per video
- Sustainable output: 2-3 videos per week

---

## PART 5: RETENTION TECHNIQUES

### **Hook Maintenance**
**Every 30-60 seconds, include ONE of:**
1. Rhetorical question ("But can he survive?")
2. Comedic callback ("Remember that foot thing? It gets weirder.")
3. Foreshadowing ("Oh, you think THAT'S bad...")
4. Visual payoff (action, fan service, dramatic reveal)
5. Meta-commentary ("The author really said 'fuck physics'")

### **Pacing Variation**
- **Fast sections:** Action, comedy, montages (1-2s per panel)
- **Medium sections:** Dialogue, setup (3-4s per panel)
- **Slow sections:** Dramatic reveals, emotional beats (5-6s per panel)
- **Never static:** Always some motion (pan/zoom)

### **Information Density**
- Constant visual + audio stimulation
- No "dead air" or empty moments
- Mind never has time to wander
- But: Controlled, not chaotic

---

## PART 6: SCALABILITY & ITERATION

### **What Makes This Sustainable**

**Template Consistency:**
- Same structure every video
- Same editing techniques
- Same narrative voice
- Minimize creative decisions = faster production

**Modular Components:**
- Script formula is fill-in-the-blanks
- Panel animation is copy-paste keyframes
- Music/sound design is consistent library
- Each video builds on previous learnings

**Quality Tiers:**
- **Tier 1 (MVP):** Simple Ken Burns, clean audio, good pacing
- **Tier 2 (Standard):** Add impact zooms, better music sync
- **Tier 3 (Premium):** Filters, effects, polished overlays
- Start at Tier 1, iterate upward

### **Iteration Strategy**
**After each video:**
1. What took longest? (optimize next time)
2. What retention metrics show? (adjust pacing)
3. What comments say? (refine style)
4. What can be templated further? (reduce decisions)

**Weekly Review:**
- Compare production times
- Identify bottlenecks
- Refine templates
- Build asset library (music, fonts, effects)

---

## PART 7: ANTI-PATTERNS (Avoid These)

### **Production Anti-Patterns**
❌ **Perfectionism:** Ship rough, iterate, don't chase perfection
❌ **Scope Creep:** Stick to template, resist "just one more effect"
❌ **Inconsistency:** Use same voice/style/structure every video
❌ **Over-Complexity:** Simple techniques executed well > complex done poorly

### **Content Anti-Patterns**
❌ **Slow Openings:** Hook must be first 30 seconds, not first 2 minutes
❌ **Over-Explanation:** Trust viewer intelligence, skip obvious stuff
❌ **Neutral Tone:** Personality sells, blandness kills
❌ **Reading Panels:** Interpret, don't just describe what's visible

### **Workflow Anti-Patterns**
❌ **Edit-As-You-Go:** Lay full timeline first, then refine
❌ **Perfect Script:** Write 80% script, record it, ship it
❌ **Panel Paralysis:** Good enough panels work, don't source forever
❌ **Tool Obsession:** Master ONE editor, don't tool-hop
