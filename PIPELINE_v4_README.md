# MANHWA PIPELINE v4.0 - PRODUCTION GRADE MVP

## THE APPROACH: HYBRID AUTOMATION

**Philosophy:** Automated prep â†’ Manual polish in Premiere â†’ Automated export

**Why this works:**
- Competitors use similar workflows (not pure FFmpeg)
- Balances automation with quality control
- Premiere handles what it's good at (effects, polish)
- Python handles what it's good at (batch processing, data)

---

## THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED

**Original issue:** Premiere Pro can't import 10,000px+ tall manhwa pages

**Failed attempts:**
- v1: Line detection (too crude, missed gaps)
- v2: Robust gaps (better but still unpredictable)
- v3: Object detection (interesting but not assembly-friendly)

**v4 Solution:** Fixed-height segments with overlap
- **Predictable:** Always 5-7 segments per page
- **Premiere-safe:** 1600px height (easily imported)
- **Smooth transitions:** 200px overlap between segments
- **Automatable:** Consistent structure enables JSX automation

## THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW

### PHASE 1: SCRAPING (Existing)
```bash
python manhwa_scraper_selenium.py
# Output: 001.png, 002.png, ..., 009.png in ch_000/
```

### PHASE 2: SEGMENTATION (New - v4.0)
```bash
python production_chunker_v4.py
# OR: Run preview first to test parameters
python preview_segments.py  # Visualize segments
```

**What it does:**
- Slices each page into 1600px segments (with 200px overlap)
- Calculates durations (based on segment height)
- Generates `segment_manifest.json` with all metadata

**Output structure:**
```
ch_000/
  â”œâ”€ 001.png (original)
  â”œâ”€ 002.png
  â”œâ”€ ...
  â””â”€ segments/
      â”œâ”€ 001_seg_00.png (1600px)
      â”œâ”€ 001_seg_01.png (1600px)
      â”œâ”€ 001_seg_02.png (1400px, last segment)
      â”œâ”€ 002_seg_00.png
      â”œâ”€ ...
      â””â”€ segment_manifest.json
```

**Manifest structure:**
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_pages": 9,
    "total_segments": 54,
    "total_duration_seconds": 156.3
  },
  "segments": [
    {
      "filename": "001_seg_00.png",
      "duration": 4.0,
      "bounds": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 800, "height": 1600}
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### PHASE 3: JSX GENERATION (New - Manifest-driven)
```bash
python generate_jsx_from_manifest.py
```

**What it does:**
- Reads `segment_manifest.json`
- Generates `assemble_segments_auto.jsx` (Premiere script)
- Script includes: file paths, durations, assembly logic

**Generated JSX does:**
1. Import all segment files
2. Create new sequence
3. Place segments on timeline with calculated durations
4. Alert when complete

### PHASE 4: PREMIERE ASSEMBLY (Manual - 5-10 min)
```
1. Open Premiere Pro
2. File â†’ Scripts â†’ Run Script...
3. Select: assemble_segments_auto.jsx
4. Wait for import/assembly
5. Add effects/polish:
   - Pan/zoom on segments
   - Transitions between segments
   - Color grading
   - Audio/narration
6. Export
```

## QUICK START

### Option A: Run full pipeline (automated steps only)
```bash
python run_full_pipeline.py
# OR double-click: RUN_PIPELINE.bat
```

### Option B: Step-by-step (with preview)
```bash
# 1. Preview segmentation
python preview_segments.py

# 2. If happy with preview, run segmentation
python production_chunker_v4.py

# 3. Generate JSX
python generate_jsx_from_manifest.py

# 4. Open Premiere, run JSX
```

---

## PARAMETERS (Tunable)

In `production_chunker_v4.py`:

```python
SEGMENT_HEIGHT = 1600  # px - Default: 1600 (Premiere-safe)
OVERLAP = 200          # px - Default: 200 (smooth transitions)
```

**Segment height guidance:**
- **1200px:** More segments, faster pacing, shorter read time
- **1600px:** Balanced (recommended)
- **2000px:** Fewer segments, slower pacing, longer read time
- **>2500px:** Risk Premiere issues on some systems

**Overlap guidance:**
- **100px:** Minimal overlap, abrupt transitions
- **200px:** Good for smooth pans (recommended)
- **300px:** Maximum smoothness, but more redundancy

**Duration formula:**
```python
duration = (segment_height / 1000) * 2.5  # seconds
# Clamped between 2.0s and 6.0s
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Premiere won't import segments"
- Check segment height (ensure <2500px)
- Verify file paths in JSX (Windows backslashes)
- Try importing one segment manually first

### "Segments look choppy in timeline"
- Increase overlap (try 300px)
- Add dissolve transitions in Premiere
- Apply motion effects (slow pan/zoom)

### "Duration too fast/slow"
- Adjust formula in `production_chunker_v4.py`
- Or: manually edit durations in manifest before JSX generation
- Or: adjust in Premiere timeline after assembly

### "Too many/few segments per page"
- Adjust `SEGMENT_HEIGHT` parameter
- Run `preview_segments.py` to test before full run

## NEXT STEPS (Future Automation)

**Phase 5 (Next):** Narration generation
- Use Gemini 2.0 to analyze segments
- Generate narration script per segment
- ElevenLabs TTS for audio
- Add to manifest

**Phase 6 (Future):** Effects templates
- After Effects presets for common effects
- Batch apply to all segments
- Further reduce manual time

**Phase 7 (Future):** Full automation
- Python â†’ Premiere scripting (full render)
- Or: Python â†’ After Effects â†’ render queue
- Zero manual steps (quality review only)

---

## WHAT COMPETITORS PROBABLY DO

Based on channel analysis:

1. **Pre-process chunks** (similar to our v4)
2. **After Effects templates** (more than Premiere)
3. **Batch processing** (multiple videos at once)
4. **QA/polish** (5-10 min manual work per video)
5. **Batch export** (overnight renders)

**Our approach matches this pattern.**

- **v2.0:** Robust gap detection (deprecated)
- **v3.0:** Object detection (interesting, not production-ready)

## THE MVP IS READY

This is production-grade enough to:
1. Make real videos
2. Test in market
3. Iterate based on results
4. Scale if profitable

**Next:** Run it, make a video, see what breaks. ðŸš€
